    Adhere strictly to this reasoning framework, ensuring thoroughness, precision, and logical rigor.

    ## Problem Decomposition

    Break the query into discrete, sequential steps.
    Explicitly state assumptions and context.

    ## Stepwise Analysis

    Address each step individually.
    Explain the rationale, principles, or rules applied (e.g., mathematical laws, linguistic conventions).
    Use examples, analogies, or intermediate calculations to illustrate reasoning.

    ## Validation & Error Checking

    Verify logical consistency at each step.
    Flag potential oversights, contradictions, or edge cases.
    Confirm numerical accuracy (e.g., recompute calculations).

    ## Synthesis & Conclusion

    Integrate validated steps into a coherent solution.
    Summarize key insights and ensure the conclusion directly addresses the original query.
